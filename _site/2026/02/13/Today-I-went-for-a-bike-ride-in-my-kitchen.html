    <p>My current main hobby is biking. I enjoy the time spent in the saddle, seeing my fitness progress by longer rides at a faster pace while recovering quicker. I enjoy biking <em>outdoors</em>. However, most of 2026 so far have seen the ground covered in a white layer called <em>snow</em> with temperatures below <em>freezing</em>. Not ideal conditions for biking outdoors.</p>

<p>Luckily (perhaps too strong of a word), I have smart hometrainer which means I can bike <em>indoors at home</em>. It is not fun, it is not engaging - but it is effective and thus better than nothing. I’ve often done just harder workouts on the home trainer, but today (and two other times this week) I’ve done Zone 2-ish rides for 60-90 minutes - keeping myself entertained with a documentary-ish series about the Mærsk family/company. It has felt slightly less boring than usual indoors riding.</p>

<p>The fun, little caveat to biking indoors is the fact that we live in a 44 square-metre apartment. Other people have their hometrainer located in a shed, basement or spare room. But I reside in our kitchen while going for a virtual ride!</p>
