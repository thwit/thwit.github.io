title: "Today I went for a bike ride in my kitchen"

My current main hobby is biking. I enjoy the time spent in the saddle, seeing my fitness progress by longer rides at a faster pace while recovering quicker. I enjoy biking _outdoors_. However, most of 2026 so far have seen the ground covered in a white layer called _snow_ with temperatures below _freezing_. Not ideal conditions for biking outdoors.

Luckily (perhaps too strong of a word), I have smart hometrainer which means I can bike _indoors at home_. It is not fun, it is not engaging - but it is effective and thus better than nothing. I've often done just harder workouts on the home trainer, but today (and two other times this week) I've done Zone 2-ish rides for 60-90 minutes - keeping myself entertained with a documentary-ish series about the Mærsk family/company. It has felt slightly less boring than usual indoors riding.

The fun, little caveat to biking indoors is the fact that we live in a 44 square-metre apartment. Other people have their hometrainer located in a shed, basement or spare room. But I reside in our kitchen while going for a virtual ride!
