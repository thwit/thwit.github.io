I've been wanting to create a blog-like personal page for a little time now. After discovering the [blog of Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) a few weeks ago, and later his post _[What to blog about](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/)_, I've finally taken the step to try it out myself. Specifically, I will treat this little site as a **Today I _{verbed}_**-style blog. Replace _verbed_ with words like _learned_ (of course), _created_, _went_, _lost_, and _found_.

Of course, there have been other factors pushing me to finally getting started - my partner (rightfully) thinks that I should write my thoughts, ideas, and funky feelings down _somewhere_ instead of sharing them _nowhere_. Thus, this place is meant as a personal collection of such. Mainly for my self - but open to the public.

As such, welcome to my blog.
